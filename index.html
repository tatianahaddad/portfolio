      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a current student in Thinkful's Full Stack Flexible bootcamp program where I have learned how to implement HTML, CSS, 
        JavaScript and jQuery to create beautifully simplistic and user-friendly websites. To be able to bring my creations to life
        has given me a constructive outlet for my creative energy. More challengingly— and more excitingly— I am now able
        to visually create and execute what my clients have envisioned for their sites and for their users to interact with.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my (sparingly) free time, I can be found on the slopes of Big Bear Mountain skiing down black diamond runs, 
        snuggled up with my cat Oscar whose resemblance to Garfield is scarily uncanny, or attempting to re-live my youth by playing
        Super Mario 64 and Donkey Kong 64.

          <p>Find out if you truly know your Pride and Prejudice trivia by submitting your answer when presented with 10 multiple choice questions one at a time, receiving feedback if the answer was correct or not, and receiving your final score results with 
              the option to play again.

            HTML was used to load the start page, JavaScript functions were used alongside jQuery libraries to provide interactive 
            material for the user to click and submit answers. In addition, inserting content material such as the questions and multiple
            choice answers into to the HTML page was accomplished through JavaScript functions and jQuery libraries.  
            CSS was used throughout to create visually striking content and to allow for a seamless UX.
