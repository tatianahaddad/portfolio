        I am a current student in Thinkful's Full Stack Flexible bootcamp program where I have learned how to implement HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery to create beautifully simplistic and user-friendly websites. To be able to bring my creations to life has given me a constructive outlet for my creative energy. More challengingly, and more excitingly, my team and I are now able to visually create and execute what my clients have envisioned for their sites and for their users to interact with.

        In my (sparingly) free time, I can be found on the slopes of Big Bear Mountain skiing down black diamond runs, snuggled up with my cat Oscar whose resemblance to Garfield is scarily uncanny, or attempting to re-live my youth by playing Super Mario 64 and Donkey Kong 64.

      <h3>Pride and Prejudice Quiz App</h3>
      <a href="https://tatianahaddad.github.io/quiz-app/" target="_blank"><img src="images/quizcorrect.png" class="pride" alt="Pride and Prejudice Quiz App correct screen"></a>
      <div class="float-paragraphs">
        <p class="content">
          Impress your friends with your knowledge of Pride and Prejudice trivia by submitting your answer when presented with 10 multiple choice questions one at a time, receiving feedback to know if the answer was correct or not, and receiving your final score results with the option to play again. Making a fun, interactive quiz based on my favorite novel was a no-brainer. I hope that those who play it are filled with happy memories about the greatest love story ever told just as I was when I created it. 
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          HTML was used to load the initial start page and serve as the container for follow-up questions and feedback pages included through the use of JavaScript functions and jQuery libraries. JavaScript functions and jQuery libraries were also used to provide interactive material for the user to click and submit answers. CSS was used throughout to create visually striking content and to allow for a seamless UX.

          HTML and CSS were used for content display and design, respectively. JavaScript was used alongside jQuery to integrate the Zomato API within the app to provide more inclusive and  interesting functionality to the user.
